Please make sure you have both.= I'd like to change something in the Flash movie, will you release the .fla? =Flash version of the file is currently available here: http://activeden.net/item/xml-flash-counter-countdown/58419 .If plugins gets a lot of downloads I will make it available for free on Wordpress.= Some characters are not showing up =Because of the way Flash handles text, only Latin characters are supported in the current version. This is due to a limitation where in order to be able to animate text fields smoothly the glyphs need to be embedded in the movie. The Flash movie's source code is available for download through Subversion. Doing so will allow you to create a version for your language. There's a text field in the root of the movie that you can use to embed more characters. If you change to another font, you'll need to edit the Tag class as well.== Screenshots ==1.
